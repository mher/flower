Handle 403 error when fetching GitHub user emails

The GithubLoginHandler crashes with an unhandled
tornado.httpclient.HTTPClientError when the GitHub OAuth app doesn't
have permission to read user emails. Wrap the email fetch request in a
try/except and raise a clear 403 error message explaining that the app
needs email read permission.
